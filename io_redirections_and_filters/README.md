# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

## 🎓 Objective

At the end of this project, I had to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google :

- What do the commands `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr` do?
- How to redirect standard output to a file.
- How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard.
- How to send the output from one program to the input of another program.
- How to combine commands and filters with redirections
- What are special characters?
- How to display a line of text.
- How to concatenate files and print on the standard output.
- How to reverse a string.
- How to remove sections from each line of files.
- What is the `/etc/passwd` file and what is its format?
- What is the `/etc/shadow` file and what is its format?
